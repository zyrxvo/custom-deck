# Welcome to `Custom-Deck`!

This is a public version of the custom theme I built myself for my own website, [zyrxvo.github.io](https://zyrxvo.github.io).

I created it because I wanted to explore how to do front-end web development but I didn't want to load large libraries just to present a static site. Thus, the theme can be used to create very lightweight sites that are almost exclusively `HTML` and `CSS`. This theme could easily be modified to remove all `JavaScript`. However, with `JavaScript` it has a few additional features.
1. Reusable code, because reusability isn't native to `HTML`.
2. An optional light and dark mode button for those who love dark mode.
3. A basic Markdown engine for easy writing and posting.
4. A basic podcast player that keeps track of where you are in each episode.

The name `Custom-Deck` come from the design of the site. Everything is predominantly divided into separate cards to display information. These cards can be arranged however you like them to build a site that works for you.

Much of what I learned in order to build this site I received from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), and more recently [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) because sometimes I don't even know how to ask the questions I have. However, this theme does include the small and fantastic work of [TimeJump](https://davatron5000.github.io/TimeJump/).

Almost all of the images on this demo-site were generated using [DiffusionBee](https://diffusionbee.com). If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me.
